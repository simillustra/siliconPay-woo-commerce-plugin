2. __Title__ - This will represent SiliconPay on your list of Payment options during checkout. It guides users to know which option to select to pay with SiliconPay. __Title__ is set to "Debit/Credit Cards" by default, but you can change it to suit your needs.
3. __Description__ - This controls the message that appears under the payment fields on the checkout page. Use this space to give more details to customers about what SiliconPay is and what payment methods they can use with it.
4. __Test Mode__ - Check this to enable test mode. When selected, the fields in step six will say "Test" instead of "Live." Test mode enables you to test payments before going live. The orders process with test payment methods, no money is involved so there is no risk. You can uncheck this when your store is ready to accept real payments.

6. __API Keys__ - The next two text boxes are for your SiliconPay API keys, which you can get from your SiliconPay Dashboard. If you enabled Test Mode in step four, then you'll need to use your test API keys here. Otherwise, you can enter your live keys.
7. __Additional Settings__ - While not necessary for the plugin to function, there are some extra configuration options you have here.
